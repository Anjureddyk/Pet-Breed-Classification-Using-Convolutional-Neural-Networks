# Pet-Breed-Classification-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
CNN pet breed classification model with 78% accuracy. TensorFlow preprocessing and augmentation. User-friendly interface for instant breed prediction. Potential for pet industry applications.

Successfully developed a pet breed classification model using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model was trained on a diverse dataset of pet images, with a focus on differentiating between various breeds. With an accuracy of 78%, the model demonstrates its ability to accurately predict the breed of a given pet image.

Using TensorFlow and its powerful image processing capabilities, the dataset was preprocessed and augmented using techniques such as resizing and normalization. The CNN architecture consisted of multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers to classify the breeds. The model was trained and evaluated on separate training and validation sets to ensure reliable performance.

By leveraging the trained model, I created a user-friendly interface where users can upload their pet images and instantly receive the predicted breed. This project not only showcases my expertise in deep learning and computer vision but also highlights my ability to build practical solutions for real-world problems. With its high accuracy and intuitive functionality, this pet breed classification model holds great potential for applications in the pet industry and beyond.
