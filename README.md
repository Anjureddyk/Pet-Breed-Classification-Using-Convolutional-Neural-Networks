# Pet-Breed-Classification-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

This project is a pet breed classification application using deep learning with the test accuracy of 23.65%. It allows users to upload an image of a pet and predicts the breed of the pet based on the trained model.

## Introduction

The Pet Breed Classification application is built using deep learning techniques and a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model. It is trained to classify various pet breeds, including dogs and cats. The trained model can predict the breed of a pet given an input image.

## Installation

To run the Pet Breed Classification application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Anjureddyk/Pet-Breed-Classification-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks.
   
## Usage

To predict the breed of a pet using the Pet Breed Classification model, follow these steps:

Prepare your input image:

Make sure you have an image of a pet that you want to classify. Ensure that the image is in a format supported by the model (e.g., JPEG, PNG).

Preprocess the image:

Before making predictions, preprocess the input image according to the model's requirements. This may include resizing the image, normalizing pixel values, or any other necessary transformations.

Make predictions:

Use the pre-trained model to make predictions on the preprocessed image. The model will output a probability distribution over the different pet breeds.

Interpret the predictions:

The predicted breed can be determined by finding the breed with the highest probability in the prediction output. You can also consider displaying the top N predicted breeds with their respective probabilities.
